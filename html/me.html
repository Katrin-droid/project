					<h1>About Us</h1>
					<hr>
					<p>We, Student Housing BV, own different building where students (our clients) can stay during their
						study in the Netherlands. Our buildings are composed of rooms, which are rented by our clients, but
						also shared facilities such as toilets, bathroom, kitchen, hallway, storage space, etc. As an extra service we want to offer our clients a software solution to better arrange day-to-day
						situation and hopefully this will reduce the amount of issues they face.
						We envision an application where our clients can record and see agreements made between them,
						but also the possibility to see the house rules and file complaint anonymously. We
						encourage additional functionalities and suggestions as long as it does not endanger the delivery of
						the application on time.</p>
